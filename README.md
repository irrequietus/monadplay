# monadplay

Back in 1971 (that is several decades ago), a man named *Saunders Mac Lane* wrote a book called *"[Categories for the Working Mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_for_the_Working_Mathematician)"*. In one of the pages, it is written:

> All told, a monad in X is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors of X, with product Ã— replaced by composition of endofunctors and unit set by the identity endofunctor. - [Saunders Mac Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saunders_Mac_Lane)

This simple file uses `std::list` and defines the two operations as free functions `unit` and `prod` in such a way as to respect this exact definition, verifies the three monadic laws allowing the infamous Kleisli triple (known as Monad) to emerge naturally. Compile it with `-std=c++14` or whatever else is your (at least) C++14 compiler enabling mode. Comments help you navigate through the implementation (it is really simple).

The reason I wrote this is because `C++` is a language that makes it difficult for such constructs (as *monads*) to emerge and be used naturally for a variety of reasons related to its design; yet, there are simple ways that these may come about, despite the mental acrobatics one must do to deploy them.

This is just one of the ways.
